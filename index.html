            <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

                Uplift mood and strengthen social skills: Simple-to-play and easy-to-access games like Angry Birds may uplift mood, promote relaxation, and develop positive emotions, like joy. The visual stimulation provided by the game can help distract the mind from boredom and frustration. Multiplayer games might help children develop positive relationships via social interaction. However, you may also try some non-screen activities to strengthen a child’s social skills.

                Give a boost to creativity: A psychological research study by Iowa State University revealed that in some situations, video games might help enhance creativity (2). Creativity is an essential skill that lets your child think out of the box.

                Video-gaming is indeed very addictive. A person developing a liking for it can go on and on with it for hours together, not even realizing the amount of time he has been spending on it. Gaming can also be extremely distracting. A person tends to lose interest in things he has been preoccupied with because the highly interactive video gaming interface tends to take control of his thought process as he gets involved. A research conducted by Dr. C. Shawn Green of the University of Wisconsin concluded, ‘video games can change your brain’. This has both positive as well as negative implications. In other words, video or computer games may have good as well as bad effects on the psyche of the individuals addicted to them. Positive impact of video games include development of qualities such as multitasking, quicker decision-making, teamwork and better response to challenges and risks. Games may also help people to develop better mathematical and analytical skills. But as the saying goes, ‘there are two sides to every coin’, despite the numerous positive effects that video games may have on an individual, some of the negatives of this technological innovation can prove to be extremely hazardous in the long-run.

                        <p class="p_modal">After watching the Netflix series and becoming somewhat obsessed, I grabbed this book at the earliest opportunity. It didn't disappoint.

WARNING: Do NOT read this book if all you want is the Trollhunters Netflix series in book form. Because the differences are enormous, albeit well-reasoned on del Toro's part. They are two different beasts that share a common blood.

Reading Trollhunters is like taking a decadent, sobering trip into the 9th circle of Dante's Inferno. It's dark. It's gritty. The trolls (especially the Gumm-Gumms) are absolutely disgusting, revolting monsters, illuminated in a way only del Toro could achieve. The descriptions in this book might actually be difficult for the faint-of-heart or queasy to power through.

The writing is gorgeous - the prose feels wonderfully atypical at times; even the simplest sentences can germinate from a place of pure originality, like a breath of fresh air.
You grow to know and love the characters.
The twists keep readers on the edges of their seats until the bittersweet end.

My singular complaint, is that this novel does read like it was meant to be an ornamented movie script. Scenes that could be more powerful in fewer words are dragged out longer than they need to be, especially action scenes; I felt that the strength of the fight scenes floundered under their own verbosity. Also, some of the smaller scenes added in near the end felt as if pulled straight from film. I've had these same feelings before while reading works from other directors, and while I enjoyed those books as well, it seems to be a common thought that nags at me.

BUT overall, I'm really glad I decided to visit the slimey underbelly that is the novel version of Trollhunters. It was vile, heartwarming, intense, and funny. And I loved it. <br>
